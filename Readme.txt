This code implements a federated learning approach combined with an autoencoder-based clustering technique for the Fashion MNIST dataset. The process consists of two phases:

Phase 1: Clustering

Data Preparation: Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
Autoencoder Training: An autoencoder neural network is trained on the data to obtain latent representations.
Clustering: Using Jensen-Shannon Divergence, the clients are clustered into groups based on the similarity of their latent representations.
Cluster Head Selection: A cluster head is selected for each cluster based on the highest value of latent space.
Phase 2: Global Training

Local Training: Each client performs local training using a SimpleMLP model, which is a multilayer perceptron neural network.
Cluster Aggregation: Trained models from each cluster are aggregated using weights calculated based on latent values, number of classes, and number of samples.
Global Aggregation: Aggregated models from each cluster are further aggregated at the global level using similar weight calculation.
This approach enables distributed learning across multiple clients while leveraging the latent representations obtained through autoencoder-based clustering for improved model aggregation and classification accuracy.
